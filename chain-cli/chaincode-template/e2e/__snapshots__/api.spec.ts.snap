JSON payload to be signed is created from an object without 'signature' and 'trace\` properties, and it's keys should be sorted alphabetically and no end of line at the end. Sample jq command to produce valid data to sign: \`jq -cSj \\".\\" dto-file.json\`.Also all BigNumber data should be provided as strings (not numbers) with fixed decimal point notation.
The EC secp256k1 signature should be created for keccak256 hash of the data. The recommended format of the signature is a HEX encoded string, including r + s + v values. Signature in this format is supported by ethers.js library. Sample signature: b7244d62671319583ea8f30c8ef3b343cf28e7b7bd56e32b21a5920752dc95b94a9d202b2919581bcf776f0637462cb67170828ddbcc1ea63505f6a211f9ac5b1b
This field can also contain a DER encoded signature, but this is deprecated and supported only to provide backwards compatibility. DER encoded signature cannot be used recover user's public key from the signature, and cannot be used with the new signature-based authorization flow for Gala Chain.
