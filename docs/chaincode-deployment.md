# Chaincode deployment

GalaChain supports TNT as a Testnet for your chaincodes. Once deployed, your chaincode will be exposed to the public through the Gateway at [https://gateway-testnet.galachain.com/docs/](https://gateway-testnet.galachain.com/docs/). Registering and deploying chaincodes is available to anyone.

## The anatomy of a chaincode from the deployment perspective

When you initialize a chaincode with `@gala-chain/cli`, it creates a chaincode directory which includes:
- The `keys` directory - containing public keys required for calling our managed infrastructure. Typically two files: `gc-admin-key.pub` and `gc-dev-key.pub`.
- The `Dockerfile` that should be used to build the chaincode Docker image.

Additionally, the `init` command creates private keys for the chaincode admin and developer in your home directory at `~/.gc-keys/<chaincode-name>` (`gc-admin-key` and `gc-dev-key`), where `<chaincode-name>` consists of a `gc-` prefix and ETH address calculated from the chaincode admin public key.

All of this is important for managing the chaincode deployment.

## Registering the chaincode

You can check if your chaincode is registered by running the following command from the chaincode directory:

```
galachain info
```

This command:
1. Uses your admin public key to determine the chaincode name (requires the `./keys/gc-admin-key.pub` file)
2. Determines the developer private key to sign the request (by default uses developer private key from `~/.gc-keys/<chaincode-name>` directory, but there are also other options to provide it)
3. Signs the request with the developer private key and calls the TNT Gateway to get the chaincode deployment information

On the first call, since your chaincode is not registered yet, you will get an unauthorized error. Example:

```
Error: [401] Cannot authorize access to chaincode on network TNT.

  Operation ID:         EHpFVcHpaBejni2yzQ2WX
  Chaincode:            gc-ab4a643F9f26d933c1bE9Dd8f5057f0F5c820f25
  Developer public key: 04b70f2b896dff49d2da338a3b021dc28aafa5e34712fc59948d64ecc354bb671a940d652763a16b91e208f4b244cc0842d82ac4863b8a7c562808f52a0908e670

It usually means that the chaincode is not registered on TNT, or you are using 
the wrong developer key for signing. If you are sure that the chaincode is 
registered on TNT, please check your developer key. Otherwise, you can register 
the chaincode with `galachain register` command (requires @gala-chain/cli 
version 2.2.0 or higher).
```

You will get the same error if you try to deploy non-registered chaincode.

To **register a chaincode**, run the following command:

```
galachain register
```

The command uses the chaincode admin public key to determine the chaincode name and uses all files that match the pattern `./keys/gc-dev*-key*.pub` as developer public keys. This way you can provide multiple developers during registration by including files like `gc-dev2-key.pub` or `gc-dev-key2.pub` as additional developer key files. It is safe to keep developer public keys in version control.

The CLI register command serves the following prompt to confirm the registration:

```

Are you sure you want to register the chaincode on TNT? (y/n): y
```

And once you confirm it will display the information about the registered chaincode:

```
Chaincode gc-ab4a643f9f26d933c1be9dd8f5057f0f5c820f25 has been registered:
{
  "channel": "testnet01",
  "chaincode": "gc-ab4a643f9f26d933c1be9dd8f5057f0f5c820f25",
  "imageName": null,
  "status": "CH_CREATED",

  ]
}
```

After that step you are able to deploy the chaincode.


## Preparing the chaincode Docker image

To deploy a chaincode to TNT, you need to build and publish a chaincode Docker image.

The image should be built with the `Dockerfile` provided by the `galachain init` command. This ensures the image has the proper format and can be used as a chaincode. The CLI performs initial validation of the image before deployment to prevent deploying an incorrect image.

The image needs to be publicly available so GalaChain services can access and deploy it. We do not recommend using temporary Docker image registries (like [ttl.sh](ttl.sh)), as they may not allow redeployment if needed.

The Docker image must be built for the `linux/amd64` architecture.


## Deploying the chaincode

To deploy the chaincode, run the following command:

```
galachain deploy <your-docker-image:tag>
```

The CLI will verify the Docker image locally, and produce a similar prompt for confirmation:

```
Verifying Docker image registry.gitlab.com/dzikowski.online/galachain-sample:1.0.24...

  Chaincode:    gc-ab4a643f9f26d933c1be9dd8f5057f0f5c820f25

   - GalaChainToken

Are you sure you want to deploy the chaincode gc-ab4a643f9f26d933c1be9dd8f5057f0f5c820f25 to TNT? (y/n): y
```

If you are working on Apple M processor, you may also see a warning: _The requested image's platform (linux/amd64) does not match the detected host platform (linux/arm64/v8) and no specific platform was requested_, but this is just a result of performing local validation of the image, and you can ignore it.

Once you confirm the deployment, you will receive a response similar to:

```

  "chaincode": "gc-ab4a643f9f26d933c1be9dd8f5057f0f5c820f25",

  ],
  "imageName": null,
  "sequence": 1,
  "status": "CC_DEPLOY_SCHEDULED",
  "lastUpdated": "2025-04-08T16:30:03.757Z"
}
```

Your chaincode will typically be available on GalaChain Gateway within 1-5 minutes. You can verify its status using the `galachain info` command.


## Call the deployed chaincode

You can use any REST API client (like `axios`, `fetch`, or `undici`) to call your chaincodes. Remember that in most cases you will need to sign the DTO with either the `gc-admin-key` or any registered user's key.

We highly recommend using the `@gala-chain/api` library for handling DTOs and signing. For instance, you can register a user by calling `/api/.../...-PublicKeyContract/RegisterEthUser` and providing the following [`RegisterEthUser`](https://galahackathon.com/latest/chain-api-docs/classes/RegisterEthUserDto/) as payload:

```typescript
const dto = new RegisterEthUser();
dto.publicKey = <newUserPublicKey>;
dto.sign(<gc-admin-key>);
const payloadString = dto.serialize();
```
