### Question


What's the best way to handle chaincode upgrades?


### Answer


Chaincode upgrades in GalaChain require careful planning and execution. Here's a comprehensive guide:

1. Version Management:
   - Use semantic versioning for chaincode versions
   - Document all changes between versions
   - Keep track of state schema changes
   - Consider backward compatibility

2. State Migration Example:
```typescript
class GameContract extends Contract {
  @Submit()
  async migrateState(
    ctx: GalaChainContext,
    params: { batchSize: number }
  ): Promise<void> {
    // Verify admin permissions
    if (!ctx.callingUser.hasRole('ADMIN')) {
      throw new Error('Only admins can migrate state');
    }

    // Get items to migrate
    const oldItems = await getStateRange(ctx, OldGameItem);
    let migratedCount = 0;

    // Process in batches
    for (const item of oldItems) {
      if (migratedCount >= params.batchSize) {
        break; // Continue in next transaction
      }

      // Convert to new format
      const newItem = new GameItem({
        ...item,
        newField: computeNewField(item),
        schemaVersion: '2.0'
      });

      // Store new version
      await putChainObject(ctx, newItem);
      migratedCount++;
    }

    ctx.logger.info('State migration progress', {
      migratedCount,
      remaining: oldItems.length - migratedCount
    });
  }
}
```

3. Upgrade Best Practices:
   - Test upgrades thoroughly in development environment
   - Plan for rollback scenarios
   - Implement state validation checks
   - Use progressive migrations for large state changes
   - Keep old state readable during migration

4. Deployment Considerations:
   - Schedule upgrades during low-traffic periods
   - Notify all network participants in advance
   - Coordinate with all organization admins
   - Verify endorsement policy requirements
   - Monitor the upgrade process closely

Note: Always maintain comprehensive documentation of your upgrade process, including state changes, new features, and any required actions from network participants.
