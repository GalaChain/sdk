### Question


What's the best way to handle cross-chaincode calls?


### Answer


It's important to understand that cross-chaincode calls are not supported in GalaChain. Here's what you need to know:

1. Channel Concepts in Hyperledger Fabric:
   - Channels in Hyperledger Fabric effectively function as separate chains
   - Each channel maintains its own ledger and state database
   - Chaincodes deployed on different channels cannot directly interact

2. Cross-Channel Limitations:
   - Read-only queries across channels are technically possible but limited
   - Cross-channel write operations are not supported
   - Each chaincode operates within its own channel context

3. Cross-Chain Interactions:
   - True cross-chain operations (e.g., with Ethereum or Solana) require specialized bridge solutions
   - Token bridging between chains is possible but handled by dedicated infrastructure
   - These are advanced use cases not typically encountered in regular GalaChain SDK development

4. Best Practices:
   - Design your application to operate within a single channel
   - If cross-chain functionality is needed, work with the GalaChain team
   - Consider using event-driven architectures for cross-channel communication

Note: As a GalaChain SDK developer, focus on building functionality within your assigned channel. Cross-chain or cross-channel operations are specialized cases handled at the infrastructure level.
