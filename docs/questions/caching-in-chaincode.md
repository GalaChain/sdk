### Question


How do I implement caching in chaincode?


### Answer


Caching in GalaChain is automatically handled by the `GalaChainStubCache`. Here's what you need to know:

1. Automatic Caching:
   - The SDK handles caching automatically
   - No manual cache implementation required
   - Works within transaction boundaries
   - Optimizes frequent reads of the same data

2. Using the Cache:
```typescript
class GameContract extends Contract {
  @Submit()
  async processGameItems(
    ctx: GalaChainContext,
    params: { itemId: string }
  ): Promise<void> {
    // These calls automatically use the stub cache
    const item = await getObjectByKey(ctx, GameItem, params.itemId);
    
    // Multiple reads of the same item use cache
    const sameItem = await getObjectByKey(ctx, GameItem, params.itemId);
    
    // Range queries also use cache
    const items = await getObjectsByPartialCompositeKey(
      ctx,
      GameItem.INDEX_KEY,
      [item.owner]
    );
  }
}
```

3. How It Works:
   - Reads are cached in memory during transaction
   - Writes are held in cache until transaction completion
   - Cache is automatically flushed at transaction end
   - All updates are written together

4. Benefits:
   - Improved performance for repeated reads
   - Consistent view of state within transaction
   - Reduced world state database load
   - Automatic cache management

Note: The stub cache is specifically designed for transaction-level caching. For cross-transaction data access patterns, consider implementing appropriate data structures and query patterns in your chaincode.
