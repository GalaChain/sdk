### Question


What are the best practices for chaincode dependency management?


### Answer


Proper dependency management is crucial for GalaChain chaincode. Here's what you need to know:

1. Version Alignment:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@gala-chain/api": "2.0.0",
    "@gala-chain/chaincode": "2.0.0"
  }
}
```

2. Key Requirements:
   - All GalaChain packages should use the same version
   - Pin exact versions (avoid ^ or ~ version ranges)
   - Prevent duplicate dependencies in node_modules
   - Keep dependencies up to date with compatible versions

3. Common Issues to Avoid:
   - Mixed versions of GalaChain packages
   - Nested duplicates in node_modules
   - Incompatible peer dependencies
   - Unnecessary dependencies that bloat chaincode size

4. Best Practices:
   - Use package-lock.json or yarn.lock for deterministic installs
   - Regularly audit dependencies for security issues
   - Remove unused dependencies
   - Test thoroughly after dependency updates
   - Document dependency requirements

Note: Mismatched versions between `@gala-chain/api` and `@gala-chain/chaincode` can cause runtime errors and unexpected behavior. Always ensure these packages are using the same version number.
