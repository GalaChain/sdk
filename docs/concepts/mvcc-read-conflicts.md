# MVCC_READ_CONFLICT Errors

## Overview

MVCC_READ_CONFLICT errors in Hyperledger Fabric occur during transaction validation when multiple transactions attempt to modify the same state concurrently. These errors are a consequence of Fabric's Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) system, which ensures that changes applied to the ledger remain consistent across the network.

A similar error, `PHANTOM_READ_CONFLICT` occurs when the MVCC conflict occurs within the results set of a range query, versus from a direct key lookup. 

In the context of GalaChain SDK (built on Hyperledger Fabric), these errors can become particularly problematic in high-throughput applications where assets are frequently updated.

## How MVCC Works in GalaChain

1. When a transaction begins, it reads values from the world state at a specific version.
2. During validation, Fabric checks if the keys read by the transaction have been modified since that version.
3. If any keys were updated by other transactions that were committed in the meantime, the transaction fails with an MVCC_READ_CONFLICT error.

## Common Causes in GalaChain Applications

1. **High-contention assets**: Digital assets that are frequently updated by multiple users
2. **Batched operations**: Operations that read and write to multiple assets simultaneously
3. **Hot keys**: Frequently accessed state elements like counters or configuration values

## Data Modeling Best Practices for GalaChain

### 1. Separate Read-Heavy and Write-Heavy Properties

```typescript
// Instead of this (prone to conflicts):
interface Asset {
  id: string;
  owner: string;           // frequently updated
  metadata: string;        // frequently read
  lastTransactionTime: number;  // frequently updated
  attributes: string[];    // frequently read
}

// Consider splitting into:
interface AssetCore {
  id: string;
  metadata: string;        // rarely changes
  attributes: string[];    // rarely changes
}

interface AssetState {
  id: string;              // reference to core asset
  owner: string;           // frequently updated
  lastTransactionTime: number;  // frequently updated
}
```

### 2. Implement Reference-Based Models

Store relationships between entities using references rather than embedding:

```typescript
// Reference-based data modeling
interface Player {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  // Reference items by ID instead of embedding
  inventory: string[];  // Array of Item IDs
}

interface Item {
  id: string;
  type: string;
  properties: object;
}
```

### 3. Use Composite Keys for Related Data

```typescript
// In GalaChain chaincode:
async storeRelatedData(ctx: Context, assetId: string, dataType: string, value: any) {
  const compositeKey = ctx.stub.createCompositeKey('asset-data', [assetId, dataType]);
  await ctx.stub.putState(compositeKey, Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(value)));
}
```

### 4. Implement Time-Based Partitioning

```typescript
// For time-series data or event logs
interface ActivityLog {
  assetId: string;
  timestamp: number;
  action: string;
  // The key could be: `${assetId}_${timePartition}_${uniqueId}`
  // where timePartition might be a date like "2023-10-15"
}
```

## Handling MVCC Conflicts in GalaChain

1. **Retry mechanisms**: Implement exponential backoff for critical operations
2. **Optimistic concurrency**: Include version fields in your data models
3. **Batching strategy**: Group related operations to minimize contention

## Conclusion

By carefully designing your data models to separate frequently-read properties from frequently-written ones, you can significantly reduce MVCC_READ_CONFLICT errors in your GalaChain applications. This improves throughput, reduces failed transactions, and enhances the overall user experience.
