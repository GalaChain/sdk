**Thanks to Our Team:**

A special thanks to the talented individuals from [Gala Games](https://www.gala.com/) Chain Team who laid the foundation of the SDK we are publishing.
The SDK, had been developed internally over the past two years before its public release in January 2024, and used in production for over a year.
Now it has reached new heights, thanks to your commitment.
