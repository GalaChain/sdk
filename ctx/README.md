## Context, Short-term memory for AI, Design, Planning, Working Directory

The purpose of this directory is to store documenation, designs, planning, 
implementation checklists, work logs, and/or progress for use with AI tools 
like Claude Code and others. 

These documents often don't make sense as part of the broader documentation site 
(files stored in this repository in /docs) yet are worth maintaining for 
tracking design decisions and architectural evolution.
