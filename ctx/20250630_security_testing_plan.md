# DeFi Lending Protocol - Security Testing Plan

**Date**: June 30, 2025  
**Role**: Application Security Engineer  
**Objective**: Identify vulnerabilities through adversarial testing

## 🎯 Security Testing Methodology

### Approach: Adversarial Unit Testing
- **Assume application code works as designed** (don't modify implementation)
- **Write tests that should pass** if the protocol is secure
- **Use realistic attack vectors** that could bypass validation
- **Focus on edge cases** and unexpected input combinations
- **Test business logic flaws** that unit tests might miss

### Success Criteria
- **Failing test = Potential vulnerability discovered**
- **Passing test = Security control verified**
- Document all attack vectors attempted
- Prioritize findings by severity and exploitability

## 🏴‍☠️ Attack Vector Categories

### 1. **Reentrancy & State Manipulation Attacks**

#### 1.1 Cross-Function Reentrancy
**Attack Theory**: Call liquidation during repayment or vice versa
```typescript
// Test: Simultaneous liquidation and repayment of same loan
it("should prevent reentrancy between repayment and liquidation", async () => {
  // Setup undercollateralized loan
  // Attempt to repay loan while liquidation is in progress
  // Should fail or handle gracefully
});
```

#### 1.2 Multiple Liquidation Attempts
**Attack Theory**: Liquidate same loan multiple times before state updates
```typescript
it("should prevent double liquidation of same loan", async () => {
  // Create undercollateralized loan
  // Attempt multiple liquidation calls in rapid succession
  // Only first should succeed
});
```

#### 1.3 State Race Conditions
**Attack Theory**: Cancel offer while someone is accepting it
```typescript
it("should handle offer cancellation during acceptance gracefully", async () => {
  // Create offer
  // Simultaneously cancel and accept offer
  // Should result in consistent state
});
```

### 2. **Economic & Financial Attacks**

#### 2.1 Self-Lending Attacks
**Attack Theory**: Lend to yourself for economic manipulation
```typescript
it("should prevent or handle self-lending scenarios", async () => {
  // Create offer with user A as lender
  // Attempt to accept offer with user A as borrower
  // Should either prevent or handle safely
});
```

#### 2.2 Circular Collateral Attacks
**Attack Theory**: Use loan proceeds as collateral for another loan
```typescript
it("should prevent circular collateral dependencies", async () => {
  // Take loan A with collateral X
  // Use loan A proceeds as collateral for loan B
  // Attempt to liquidate - should not create impossible state
});
```

#### 2.3 Liquidation Front-Running
**Attack Theory**: Front-run liquidation with minimal repayment
```typescript
it("should handle liquidation front-running attempts", async () => {
  // Setup undercollateralized loan
  // Submit minimal repayment to bring just above threshold
  // Immediately attempt liquidation
  // Should respect updated health factor
});
```

#### 2.4 Interest Rate Manipulation
**Attack Theory**: Exploit interest calculation timing
```typescript
it("should prevent interest manipulation through timing attacks", async () => {
  // Create loan with high interest rate
  // Manipulate blockchain time if possible
  // Verify interest calculations remain accurate
});
```

### 3. **Input Validation & Edge Case Attacks**

#### 3.1 Zero and Negative Amount Attacks
```typescript
it("should reject zero amount operations", async () => {
  // Attempt to create offer with 0 principal
  // Attempt to repay 0 amount
  // Attempt to liquidate 0 amount
  // All should fail gracefully
});

it("should handle edge case minimum amounts", async () => {
  // Test with 1 wei equivalent amounts
  // Test precision limits
  // Verify no rounding errors create exploits
});
```

#### 3.2 Extreme Value Attacks
```typescript
it("should handle maximum value inputs safely", async () => {
  // Test with MAX_UINT256 equivalent amounts
  // Test with extremely high interest rates
  // Verify no overflows or unexpected behavior
});
```

#### 3.3 Invalid Token Reference Attacks
```typescript
it("should validate token references thoroughly", async () => {
  // Attempt to use non-existent token classes
  // Attempt to use same token for principal and collateral
  // Verify proper validation occurs
});
```

### 4. **Authorization & Access Control Attacks**

#### 4.1 Unauthorized Liquidation Attempts
```typescript
it("should prevent liquidation of healthy loans", async () => {
  // Create well-collateralized loan
  // Attempt liquidation with various attackers
  // Should fail even if attacker has funds
});
```

#### 4.2 Unauthorized Repayment Attacks
```typescript
it("should handle unauthorized repayment attempts", async () => {
  // Create loan between A and B
  // Attempt repayment by attacker C
  // Verify proper authorization or safe handling
});
```

#### 4.3 Cross-User Operation Attacks
```typescript
it("should prevent cross-user offer manipulation", async () => {
  // User A creates offer
  // User B attempts to cancel A's offer
  // Should fail with proper authorization error
});
```

### 5. **Precision & Calculation Attacks**

#### 5.1 Rounding Error Exploitation
```typescript
it("should prevent precision loss exploitation", async () => {
  // Create loan with amounts that cause rounding
  // Attempt to exploit rounding in liquidation calculations
  // Verify no value can be extracted through rounding
});
```

#### 5.2 Interest Calculation Edge Cases
```typescript
it("should handle interest calculation edge cases", async () => {
  // Test loans with very short durations
  // Test loans with very long durations
  // Test interest accumulation limits
});
```

#### 5.3 Health Factor Manipulation
```typescript
it("should prevent health factor calculation gaming", async () => {
  // Create loan near liquidation threshold
  // Attempt various manipulations to avoid liquidation
  // Verify health factor remains accurate
});
```

### 6. **Business Logic & Workflow Attacks**

#### 6.1 Offer Acceptance Edge Cases
```typescript
it("should handle partial offer acceptance edge cases", async () => {
  // Create offer for amount X
  // Accept for amount X+1 (more than available)
  // Accept for dust amount (less than minimums)
  // Verify proper handling
});
```

#### 6.2 Loan Lifecycle Manipulation
```typescript
it("should prevent invalid loan state transitions", async () => {
  // Attempt to repay already repaid loan
  // Attempt to liquidate already liquidated loan
  // Attempt operations on non-existent loans
});
```

#### 6.3 Collateral Unlocking Attacks
```typescript
it("should prevent premature collateral unlocking", async () => {
  // Create active loan
  // Attempt to unlock collateral without repayment
  // Verify collateral remains locked
});
```

### 7. **Integration & External Dependency Attacks**

#### 7.1 Token Balance Manipulation
```typescript
it("should handle unexpected balance changes", async () => {
  // Create loan
  // Simulate external token balance changes
  // Verify protocol handles gracefully
});
```

#### 7.2 Allowance System Exploitation
```typescript
it("should prevent allowance system bypasses", async () => {
  // Attempt operations without proper allowances
  // Test allowance exhaustion scenarios
  // Verify our custom liquidation logic is secure
});
```
